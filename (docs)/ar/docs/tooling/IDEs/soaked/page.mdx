focuses on visual prompt chaining with a graphical interface. It is currently in

## Features

Soaked provides a graphical interface for chaining prompts together,
where you can easily see how different components flow together. It also
provides a lower level prompt view with the option to generate multiple
completions at once. It also provides a cost estimate for completions. It currently supports GPT3 and requires an OpenAI key to use.
