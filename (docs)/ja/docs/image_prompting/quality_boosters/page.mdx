# ðŸŸ¢ Quality Boosters

Quality boosters(@oppenlaender2022taxonomy) are terms added to a prompt to improve
certain non-style-specific qualities of the generated image. For example "amazing", "beautiful", and "good quality" are all quality boosters that can be used to improve the quality of the generated image.

# Example

Recall from the other page the pyramids generated with DALLE, and the prompt `pyramid`.

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <Image
    src="/docs/assets/images_chapter/pyramids.webp"
    className="img-docs"
    width={2340}
    height={592}
    style={{ width: "750px", margin: "auto" }}
  />
</div>

Now take at pyramids generated with this prompt:

<AIInput>A beautiful, majestic, incredible pyramid, 4K</AIInput>

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <Image
    src="/docs/assets/images_chapter/special_pyramids.webp"
    className="img-docs"
    width={2314}
    height={568}
    style={{ width: "750px", margin: "auto" }}
  />
</div>

These are much more scenic and impressive!

Here is a list of a number of quality boosters:

```text
High resolution, 2K, 4K, 8K, clear, good lighting, detailed, extremely detailed, sharp focus, intricate, beautiful, realistic+++, complementary colors, high quality, hyper detailed, masterpiece, best quality, artstation, stunning
```

## Notes

Similar to the note on the previous page, our working definition of quality boosters differs from Oppenlaender et al.(@oppenlaender2022taxonomy). This being said, it is
sometimes difficult to exactly distinguish between quality boosters and style modifiers.
