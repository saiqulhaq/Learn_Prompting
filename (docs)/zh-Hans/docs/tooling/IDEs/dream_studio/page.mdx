# Dream Studio

[Dream Studio](https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/dream) is a website for generating images with Stable Diffusion,
a text to image model.

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <Image
    src="/docs/assets/tooling/dreamstudio.webp"
    width={1433}
    height={767}
    style={{ width: "750px", margin: "auto" }}
  />
</div>

## Features

Dream studio's main feature is the ability to adjust various configuration parameters
of the model, such as height/width of the generated image and steps/sampling algorithm. It allows for in/outpainting.

It currently has an underdeveloped history view (it appears to save pixelated versions of the images to a browser cache, but there is no way to view them).
